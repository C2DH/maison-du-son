I am Pol Schlottert, currently a Master Student in the Master for Contemporary History at the University of Luxembourg.
From 2017-2020 I studied History at the Albert-Ludwigs Universit√§t in Freiburg im Breisgau before switching to the University of Luxembourg.
I got my Bachelors degree in 2022. My BA-Thesis dealt with rumours in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg during World War 1.
My MA-Thesis deals with the representation of civilians in digital war games.
