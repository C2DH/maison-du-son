I have studied both in Germany and Luxembourg and am a Student Assistant in the Project Letterbox of the C2DH, led by Prof. Beno√Æt Majerus. My BA-Thesis was on Luxembourg's Holding Law of 1929 and my MA-Thesis will contribute further to the study of Holding companies before, during and after World War II. </div>
