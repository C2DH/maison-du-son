2601: “Hello. My name is Philips 2601 and this is my biography. I am a radio and a piece of furniture in one! I was built by the Philips company in Eindhoven, in the Netherlands, in 1931 or 1933. I don’t really know when exactly I was built, because nobody could find a date on one of my parts. But according to the gentleman in whose collection I live for the moment, I was definitely built in 1931 or 1933.”
