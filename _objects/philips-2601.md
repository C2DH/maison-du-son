2601: “Hello. My name is Philips 2601 and this is my biography. I am a radio and a piece of furniture in one! I was built by the Philips company in Eindhoven, in the Netherlands, in 1931 or 1933. I don’t really know when exactly I was built, because nobody could find a date on one of my parts. But according to the gentleman in whose collection I live for the moment, I was definitely built in 1931 or 1933.”
2511: “Helloooo.”
2601: “Oh yes. You are also here. I nearly forgot about you.”
2511: “Wow. That is nice of you to say.”
2601: “I am sorry. Please introduce yourself too.”
2511: “Hi people! My name is Philips 2511, I was built on the 16th of July in 1930, and I am 2601’s predecessor. In what way, we are going to tell you in a bit.”
2601: “Since this is my biography, let’s talk about me first.”

2601: “Like I already told you, I was built by the Philips company in either 1931 or 1933. If you open the appendix to this audio file, you can see me in the first picture. Philips first created my radio type in 1930. My exterior is dark red and black, while the cover of my loudspeaker has got a pattern of yellow and black. This is not a good picture of me otherwise you would really see my exact colors. Therefore, I looked for another photograph of a Philips 2601. In this picture, you can clearly see what I look like. The cover of my loudspeaker is decorated with the Logo of Philips. You probably immediately recognized this symbol. The stars represent the main product of the company, which were the light bulbs and the waves stand for the waves of the radio, through which you can hear broadcasting and music coming out of me. If you look above my loudspeaker, you can see my buttons. The turning knob on the left is for tuning control. The other one on the right is for volume control. I also got a loudspeaker filter and a master switch. My whole exterior is made from a material called “Philite”. This is quite a funny name. This material is similar to bakelite, but the Philips company had to name it differently because of patent rights. I am 81 cm high, 53 cm long and 30 cm wide and I have four small legs. I have a weight of 40 kilograms, which is a lot compared to these small radios from today. That is because of my interior that I am this heavy. Take a look at the 3rd picture in the appendix and you see how I look like from the inside. I look very complex, don’t I? Without the explanations of my owner, I wouldn’t even know myself what all of this is! In order for you to understand what where is, I’ve given you a schematic of myself. I am only giving you the most important details, since this is even too technical for me. As you can see, I have 5 tubes, my wavebands are long- and mediumwave and I’ve got direct amplification. And my big built-in loudspeaker is visible here! Here, listen to what music sounds like when it comes out of me:
