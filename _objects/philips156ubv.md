## History 

The Philips 156 UBV was produced since 1942 in the dutch Philips factories that were under german control. It was used by the Wehrmacht during World War II at the front, but not for military purposes, but to supply soldiers with news from home or entertainment. There were radio stations that were explicitly directed towards soldiers, the most known one is Radio Belgrad. With these radio stations and its entertainment the idea was to keep the spirits of the soldiers high.

## Object Biography 

**1. Prologue**

I do not know much about the device, which was called Philips 156 UBV. He  disappeared as suddenly as he appeared. One morning, the radio stood with us other radios in the back of the warehouse, exactly on the opposite shelf, and introduced itself, but without going into detail about his past. The appearance was immediately striking, he was almost spectacularly unspectacular. Made of wood and painted with gray paint. The corners were reinforced with metal. On the front you could see the volume control, as well as the power switch, the tone control, and the wavelength switch.  Actually, it was just a wooden box with buttons and cutouts for the sound and for the dial. This effect was even enhanced by a flap that could be used to cover the front. Closed, it was not even possible to see that it was a radio. There was also a handle on the top for carrying. Due to the rather pragmatic and not very aesthetic appearance, one could quite quickly conclude that this would not be an ordinary radio, which stands in a living room, but a device, which relied on compactness, robustness, and mobility. In addition, he exuded a certain flexibility, as he could be powered by electricity or a rechargeable battery.  He had 5 tubes  and was able to receive longwave, mediumwave, and shortwave.  About his origin and function he was not willing to reveal much. The only information one could get from him was that he was manufactured in the Philips factories in Eindhoven from about 1942 and that his main function was entertaining people. So, in that respect, he was like us. However, this still did not explain why he looked the way he did. I shouldn't care, with his looks it was clear that he wasn't beautiful enough to be displayed in the front of the store in the display case, no one would buy one of these to put in their living room. So, in that respect, he was no competition. During the short time he spent here with us at the warehouse, he was rather reserved and shy, often appearing apathetic and disinterested. The competition between all the radios to see which one would be the next to be put in the display window and sold seemed to completely pass him by. If he hadn't been placed directly in my field of vision, I probably wouldn't have even noticed his presence. At times it seemed as if he came from a completely different world, living for himself. After a while, rumors started to circulate that he was a radio of the Wehrmacht, which had served at the front during the war. Used as a troop-support receiver  to keep the soldiers happy. This was a red flag to many radios here in the warehouse. Some radios distanced themselves from this point on, as they wanted nothing to do with radios of this type, but for others, fascination prevailed. However, his own apathy and disinterest made him unpopular on both sides. Some didn't understand why he didn't want to tell stories from the war, and others felt that his lived disinterest showed that he didn't care about what happened during the war years, he didn't realize the seriousness of the situation in post-war Germany. However, like everything else, this did not seem to interest him one bit. He didn't let anything get to him and seemed to have a strong personality. In my eyes, it was precisely this that made him somehow likable, since at no time did, he go into all the squabbling between the radios. Then one morning he was gone, without warning, replaced by a radio that was similar to him in some ways, but much nicer. Only his diary, left behind, provided information about his thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Somehow, I still like to think of him and wonder where he is right now. Inconspicuous, yet strange, unimpressive, yet experienced so much, the Philips 156 UBV.

**2. War Diary of the Philips 156 UBV**

**Unknown date in 1942 in Eindhoven:**
So, I'm supposed to contribute to the war? What exactly my mission is and where I will be sent is not yet clear to me. However, I don't think it will be a particularly important role, my appearance is too plain for that. I'm just a wooden box with buttons. I cannot deny a certain jealousy towards the Volksempfänger or the Torn.E.b.. Both have been in service much longer and already from their appearance, you can see their importance. One is a metal field radio with various connections, buttons, and displays, suitable for field use. The other, on the other hand, is a simple piece of furniture that has its importance on the home front. It's hard to know my place and the meaning of my existence in this whole situation

**A few days later:**
Today I was finally enlightened about what my mission is. I almost blew my loudspeaker; I actually have to go to the front. I am supposed to ensure that the morale of the soldiers at the front is kept up. In addition, it is important for the further course of the war to form a fighting community. I'm supposed to be responsible for these tasks, but I only get more precise details when I'm at the front.

**Day of arrival at the front:**
Today I arrived at the front and was told exactly my area of responsibility. The feeling of fear was indescribable. It was worse than I could have imagined in my worst nightmares. Pain and horror adorned the soundscape and I asked myself how such a small and unspectacular radio like me could compete with guns and bombs. However, I didn't have time to think about this question any longer, because I was informed about my task as soon as I arrived. Imagined listening community is the keyword. Listening to the radio together is supposed to create a sense of community among the listeners. I am supposed to help bridge the distance between the home front and the war front, thus creating a bond between the soldiers at the front and the people at home. This is to happen by means of specific radio programs, such as the wish concert for the Wehrmacht, where soldiers are allowed to wish for songs which are then played. I am also supposed to help keep people happy with light entertainment because neither the people in Germany nor the soldiers at the front are able to concentrate long enough for a more demanding radio program due to the pressure and stress of the war.

**Christmas 1942:**
Today a very big event took place to strengthen the bond between the war front and the home front and I am in a way proud of my own achievement. For Christmas, the Weihnachtsringsendung was broadcasted where 30 transmitting stations from Stalingrad to the Atlantic coast and from Scandinavia to North Africa were set up to celebrate Christmas together. Each station spoke and then Christmas carols were sung together. I was the link between the people sitting in their warm living rooms and the people who must stay here in the cold mud.

**1943:**
♫ Vor der Kaserne, vor dem großen Tor
Stand eine Laterne und steht sie noch davor
So woll’n wir uns da wiedersehn
Bei der Laterne woll’n wir stehen
Wie einst Lili Marleen ♫
Pressure is what I feel. While singing, I realized once again what a responsibility I have. I don't really feel like singing, but bringing people some distraction and joy gives me energy and motivates me, I have found the meaning of my existence. The soldiers, gathered around me, sing the song Lili Marleen every evening. I receive the signal daily from 21:56 to 22:00 from the military station in Belgrade. Radio Belgrade is one of the most popular stations at the moment, which has to do with the fact that the presenters partly take care of the music composition and the transitional lyrics themselves, which is an antithesis to the strict Reichssender.

**December 1944:**
The last few months have been a disaster. We are losing more and more ground and the situation is getting worse. Since this month, even some German radio stations, which can only be received at night, have been questioning the government for making too many mistakes. It is a German underground radio station behind the German lines, which provides the soldiers with information about the war situation. I notice how the soldiers have built up more and more trust in the station and rely on its information. 

**End of April 1945:**
For about four months I was able to receive the signals but for a few days now nothing has been heard. The suspicion is spreading that it was an Allied trap.

**A few days later:**
Today I got confirmation that 1212 was indeed a camouflaged station belonging to the Americans. They were supposedly broadcasting from Junglinster, giving messages and orders. This news was like a slap in the face. I was sent to the front to strengthen cohesion and to keep up the morale of the soldiers. The soldiers' stamina was to be as high as possible. In the end, however, I was used by the Allies to make the soldiers doubt our leadership and give up. I failed.

**Months after the end of the war:**
After some time, I'm getting back to you, dear diary. After the last difficult months full of losses, the war ended with our defeat. I know that there are many reasons for the failure, but I can't help the feeling that I also played a part in it. How exactly the end came I do not know. One day I was packed up and only unpacked in Germany, which also prevented me from writing down my thoughts and experiences for a longer period. When I first looked around, I was shocked by the extent of the destruction. I don't know what to do with myself and what to do next.

**A few days later:**
A few days have passed, and, in the meantime, I have been taken to a kind of warehouse. There are a lot of other radios around me. I'm ashamed of my appearance, you can see that I served in the Wehrmacht, and probably the others think that I didn't do enough to avert defeat. I tend to keep a low profile, don't want to offend anyone, I want to avoid arguments at all costs. Besides, now I simply lack the energy to discuss with other radios and indulge in the competition of who will be displayed next in the showcase for sale. I'm too busy with myself right now and with the question of the meaningfulness of my existence. What function am I supposed to perform at all? Because of my appearance, it is impossible for me to find a place in a living room like all the other normal radios. What is to become of me? Will I possibly simply be disposed of?

**One week later:**
In the last few days, many radios left the warehouse. There seems to be a great interest in used radios. New arrivals explained that the Allied troops were rather skeptical about the use of radios, fearing a German revolt. Radio production is said to have been partially halted, and radios were also confiscated.  Due to the radio shortage, military equipment is also said to be popular, a possible glimmer of hope?

**One day later:**
Where do I begin, dear diary? Last night was extremely eventful. It all started when I was taken away from the storage facility. I was firmly convinced that the store owner had finally had enough of me and wanted to make room for a radio with a higher chance of being sold. I could not even blame him for this, I would probably have done the same. I had accepted my fate; I was put down on a table and fell asleep. To my surprise, I woke up. I was standing in front of a windowpane and couldn't believe my eyes when I looked into the reflection. The ugly grey box turned into a dark brown radio with new buttons. I looked like a radio meant to be used in the living room. Furthermore, my circuitry was converted to common types of tubes, and a power cable was attached. Through all the excitement about my appearance, I had not even noticed which window it was at all that I was looking at myself in. It was the shop window.

## Sound Sources in the Archives of the Deutsches Rundfunkarchiv

There are several other snippets of programmes that got played on the front on youtube (Ringsendungen, Konzerte für die Wehrmacht etc.), but they are often not complete or not in an original state. Therefore, I contacted the Deutsches Rundfunkarchiv to get access to the full and original versions, because they have a big collection of material from that time.

These are two examples of sound sources in the DRA. I don't have access to these sources yet.

There are a lot more contemporary articles, which are not online. They are available in different archives, but I chose to contact the DRA, because they might have everything on one place. If not, other archives will be contacted. Currently, on the sound section of the DRA has answered my mail, but apparently an answer from the other sections (Text and Image) are coming.
