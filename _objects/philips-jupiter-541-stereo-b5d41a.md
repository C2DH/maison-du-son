**Background**:

The Philips Jupiter 541 Stereo B5D41A radio has a built-in stereo decoder and amplifier, which are covered by a wooden case. It is, in fact, a tube radio with nine tubes and four transistors, which can thus operate on several wave bands: broadcast, long-wave, short-wave, FM (frequency modulation or UHF (ultra-high frequency).

**Object Biography**: 

Jupiter, a Philips Jupiter 541 Stereo B5D41A radio, finds himself on a journey across time and space after getting his hands on a time machine. When the machine travels back around 2000 years, landing in Rome, Jupiter visits the Colosseum and grasps that the infrastructure is alive as well. It turns out that Colossus, the name of the stone infrastructure, is quite intrigued by his new little friend, so Jupiter decides it’s best to play a game to try to explain who and what he is. Consequently, realising they actually share their love for creating sound, Colossus and Jupiter go on a ride exploring different concepts of hearing and sound.  

“Wow, explaining myself to someone is way harder than I expected. What am I? Who am I? Hmm… I am not sure where to start, I am a radio actually. But you would not know what that is either. You have to keep in mind that a stone amphitheatre like you is 2000 years older than me. You would not understand the physics behind me anyway, there is just too much to cover. But in order for you to understand what I am, I will try to keep things simple. Basically, I can produce and reproduce sounds.” 
“Okay, Jupiter, it is up to you. But do not let the time difference between us confuse you. I actually know more about sound systems than you think. Even though I must admit that I have never heard the word radio before.”
“Really, how come? You do not strike me as someone familiar with concepts of sound. Even though, wait a second. I have heard in the past that actually ancient technical developments paved the way for the modern audio technology of my time. Especially when it comes to the amplification or diffusion of sound and the creation of soundscapes.”
“You see, I am telling you. But still, slow down a little bit, all this radio talk is kind of confusing. What do you mean by soundscapes?”
“Well, soundscape is a concept that refers to our sonic environment, which can be any ever-present collection of sound. More precisely, soundscape is any acoustic field of study. For instance, a radio program can be a soundscape. Contemporary soundscapes (in my case) can be studied through techniques of modern recording and analysis. At the same time, earwitness accounts from literature or even mythology can be used for the foundation of historical perspectives.” 
“Okay, thanks for explaining. That is a lot to take in. So tell me, what does radio do, and how does it work?”
“In fact, radio unites people. Sometimes people use it for the bad, but I guess that can happen to anything. Mostly though, it is a beautiful thing. Travelling through time and space, it unites people from all over the world at the same time. Looking at the technicalities, radio is the wireless transmission and reception of electric impulses or signals by means of electromagnetic waves and the use of these waves for the wireless transmission of electric impulses into which sound is converted.” 

Colossus proceeds to take a closer look at Jupiter, analysing his outward appearance in inside construction. Colossus examines the wires and transistor, and the built in stereo-decoder and amplifier, which are covered by a wooden case. Jupiter is in fact a tube radio with nine tubes and four transistors and can thus operate on several wave bands: broadcast, long-wave, short-wave, FM (frequency modulation or UHF (ultra-high frequency). 

“That is so cool!!! You know, to some extent, you do remind me of myself. People use me for cultural purposes as well, serving as a medium to reinforce the shared institutions and shared values of the entire community. In a different way, I also bring people together.  
Now, I think it is only fair that you show me what you sound like when active?” 
“Huh, interesting. Really did not think we had that much in common. 
So yeah, okay, fine, I will play something for you. Brace yourself, though, it is going to get loud now!”

Jupiter starts playing a song recording, leaving Colossus speechless of the power and sound that is leaving the box that Jupiter is. 

“That is incredible, oh my goodness!!”
“It is pretty fancy, is it not? I can even change the frequencies I am playing on. However, due to the fact that in 1st century Rome, none of the infrastructure exists to broadcast, I cannot show you that.” 
“It is. And it is crazy how much things have changed in the future. Does it scare you sometimes, thinking that you will be replaced by the next best thing that comes along, refining sound and the listening experience? Look at me, in your times, I will no longer be around.”
“I totally understand where you are coming from, Colossus. However, we have to remember that no matter how, when and who answers these questions, the way we create, perceive and interpret sound will continue to evolve. In fact, the dynamics of social change and even the perceptions of threat that come with this process are natural progressions. Hence, while social change is a vast concept regarding sound, it can create versatility in space and time.  And while it is scary sometimes, it is also exciting, do you not think so?”
“Maybe. I simply do not want to be forgotten. Imagine so many discoveries being forever forgotten. That is really sad.” 
“Rest assured, during my lifetime, people are very concerned with rediscovering things from the past, finding great ways to restore them and preserving past and present things for future generations. We have so many kinds of museums dedicated to all kinds of things and eras. Art museums, natural museums, and institutions solely dedicated to the study of Roman antiquity. Just like that, I am sure that in the future, there will be museums dedicated to sound, radio and broadcasting.”
“So you are saying that none of us will be entirely forgotten?”
“Yes, I am. Just think about it. Usually every new discovery, especially when it involves physics, is based on an older discovery. To some extent you will always be part of a new invention. Look at you for instance. What makes the acoustics of an amphitheatre so remarkable is a result of simple physical principles like the use of certain materials, geometry, and the location making an impact. Hence, the engineering infrastructure and architecture used in a site like yours enables sound to spread through great distances clearly, making it seem as though one was located just next to the speaker.  These basics are still used as an inspiration for acoustical treatment of rooms or bigger locations 2000 years from your time.”
“Alright! This makes me hopeful to think that I have a purpose in all this sound talk.” 
“Oh, there is more sound talk to come! For instance, you can separate hearing from the other senses, which to some extent, reconstructs the shape of acoustic space. Consequently, this space that is occupied by sounds can become something that is useful and formed for the purpose of different techniques of listening.  
“Adding to this, do you think that hearing could replace or take the form of a different sense?”
“Yeah, I do believe that hearing is a way of touching at a distance  in some sort. And I actually also feel like sounds are as close to us as our thoughts ”. 
“Huh, again, I never really thought of sound and hearing this deeply. I really enjoy this, though! Is there another concept you like telling me about?”
“Of course! One of my favourite things to talk about is the poetry of sound. For me, it is the idea of the poetic in radio and sound, the concept of pure sound as poetry and what poetry and sound have in common that excites me.”
“Okay, but do you not run the risk that now everything can be considered poetry? That takes some of the beauty of poetry away no?”
“Poetry is about sound and there is poetry in the way we speak, particularly when we are passionate.”  You know there are examples to be found of poetry and sound as a binome from your time until my time. In different terms, there is and was a development of poetic forms in sound broadcasting historically and geographically speaking.” 
“Hmm, does that mean you can also look at the idea of poetry in radio and the concept of pure sound beyond words?”
“Yes!”
“Okay, but I argue that for example, the sound of stones falling on the ground, does not sound very poetic to me.”
“True. However, you must know that these concepts are not only about what we hear. It is what we do not hear that allows sound to be poetic.”
“And how do you find poetry in radio, if I may ask?”
“Poetry in radio exists in many forms, the most common one being when someone is reciting a poem. Now, when reciting, the words that come out of someone’s mouth as sound only become poetry through the right intonation and intentional silence between words.  While I agree to some extent, that maybe you would not want to call everything poetry, I do believe there is poetry in pure sound itself.”
“But how is that possible? Is this approach not too subjective?”
“I see what you mean. What I realised after some time is that pure sound can be poetic through the imaginative power of the words or silence preceding or following the sound. This imaginative power can create a picture in our minds or produce colour. No matter what it is, sound usually creates some type of reaction.”
“I am not sure I agree, being honest. The ancient Greeks and my people are masters of beautiful poetry. It is the words that make it beautiful, no? That is what I believe poetry is.”
“You know, what helped me understand the concept of pure sound is realising that poetry read out loud in a foreign language is actually just a sound to me. Would you argue with that? The words have no meaning as I do not understand the language, but only by hearing the sound can they sound like poetry. It is precisely because of this that the voice and the way we speak are so important. Nevertheless, I have to preface that pure sound can only become a narrative through the poetic impulses of our imagination, which provides us with pictures or colours according to what sound we hear.” 
“When you put it like this, it does make sense. Even though I still think we are masters of poetry!!”
“Yes, and once you fully grasp that sound beyond words can generate poetic meaning, you will in a full circle moment go back to the aurality of poetry before text.” 
“Of course, it makes sense to believe that audible sounds can produce poetry.” 
“However, claiming that silence is an active thing and is maybe the most poetic sound of all, this is a more complex matter. To understand this, one must point out that silence is deeply linked to the imaginative world of the poet, the reader, or the listener. This is precisely why silence holds so much power.” 
“Yes, exactly, I agree. For example, a poet or composer can generate beauty or terror by thoughtfully juxtaposing silence with sound. This is also why a full circle moment is needed in poetry; without silence, there is no sound. In fact, this relationship between silence and sound has already existed during the time of the poets like Homer.” 
“That is true. And it does so the same during my time of radios, and it still will exist in the future. It is in the space between the soundscape and the listener that sound can express its meaning. This means everything that is embedded in silence is a poetic idea. ”
“You know, thinking of silence as something poetic just makes me realise how powerful sound in itself is. And how powerful the interplay between silence and sounds consequently is. It makes me so excited for my next performance!!”
“How I would love to experience that! Adding to this, another thing to think about is the emotional impact that sounds can have on a community. This can be of extra relevance to you as you assemble very big crowds of the population at the same time in the same place. Sometimes a specific sound can create a territorial identity for individuals always living in the range of that sound. ” 
“That is interesting. I reckon that some sounds particularly stick out. I never thought that this could be a determining factor in creating a territorial identity.”
“It is! Moreover, the range of sounds, also referred to as the aural border, can even delimit acoustic identities in a particular geopolitical area. Thus, radio sounds and music could offer audiences a sense of involvement and the immediate experience of collective identity. ”
“Well, thanks for sharing these insights with me. However, can we really consider silence as a sound? And is there something in the aural sphere that we cannot consider sound?”
“You are asking all the good questions, Colossus. In fact, most of these questions can be answered subjectively, but indeed it is difficult to find common ground, and still today, it is discussed who makes that choice. Sadly, my time to leave has come, and I will have to say goodbye. Take care, my friend!”
“Thank you, Jupiter, for telling me so much about you. I really appreciate it! It was really fun exploring all these concepts with you and seeing how much things will change in the future. Safe travels!” 


After spending the day together, Colossus and Jupiter say their goodbyes as it is time for Jupiter to continue his journey to a new destination. It will remain an unforgettable experience for both of them and after learning so much about sound, Colossus’ perception of hearing is changed forever. During the time travel back home, Jupiter breaks and gets lost. Fifty-five years later, however, a radio collector finds him at an auction and acquires him in order to restore the radio. After some modification, Jupiter can even be connected to an iPad, playing all kinds of music and videos. What a full circle moment.
