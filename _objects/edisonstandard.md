Object Biography: the “Edison Standard Phonograph”

Introduction 
“The Miracle of the 19th Century”, “The Talking Wonder”, that can enunciate and pronounce speech “in every known language”, this is how the predecessor of the object was introduced in an advertisement to the public in 1878.
  

The technical device on which this object biography is focused is the EDISON STANDARD PHONOGRAPH. The Edison Standard phonograph was invented by Thomas A. Edison in the late 1800s. This object allows both recording and playing back recorded sound. 

While we will see that Edison’s idea about the use of the phonograph was quite specific at the beginning, the full use of the Edison Standard phonograph’s recording and playback functions can be enjoyed   (please refer to footnote for youtube link) in full based on an example from the Thomas Edison National Historic Park. 



Background
Thomas Edison’s invention of the phonograph dates back to the last quarter of the 19th century, exactly 1877, being a result of two further inventions: the telegraph and the telephone.
On 6 December 1877 Thomas Edison was in his famous laboratory at Menlo Park, New Jersey, only a few kilometers away from Manhattan. This Menlo Park laboratory became later on so well-known for his famous inhabitant, not only in respect of what will happen there in relation to the phonograph, but also with respect to what he demonstrated two years later, with regard to the development of the commercially usable light bulb, that it was decided in 1954 to change the entire name of the locality  to Edison, in honor of the great inventor, Thomas Alva Edison. 
On that day in December 1877, after having been working on his invention of the phonograph for many months, there was the day where he finished his series of experiments on his apparatus. Edison shouted the poem "Mary had a little lamb" into the mouthpiece of the device. A stylus scratched the vibrations of the nursery rhyme directly into a rotating cylinder covered with tin foil. Only instants later, Edison's exact rendition of the first lines of the "Mary had a little lamb"-poem was played back to him . 
Thomas Edison exactly said the following words which he recorded on his device: “The first words I spoke in the original phonograph. A little piece of practical poetry. Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow. And everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.” Then he listened to what he had said (and recorded) seconds before. This wording can still be listened to nowadays (from digital copies of the initial recording on the tin-plated cylinder). Listeners will experience the scratchy sound of the first Edison phonograph, which is due to the metallic sound produced on the tin support.
How had Edison come up with the idea to build a phonograph? 
The idea of the phonograph came to Edison in that year 1877, when he wanted to further refine the telegraph which he had already technically improved in 1868 (which brought him his first patent). He now wanted to increase the speed of the message transmission, which was still a problem as the message could pass only as quickly as the telegraphist would write it on the support. 
Edison’s idea was to first record the Morse code message on a paper strip by indenting it thereon: then, the paper strip would be passed under a tracing point were depending on the indentation on the strip the circuit of the telegraph would open or close. The paper strip with all the message already on it could be passed quicklier than the telegraphist would be able to typewrite the message while passing it under the tracing point. Edison tried this procedure and realized the noise was a sound which was like "a musical, rhythmic sound resembling that of human talk heard indistinctly." 
The noise showed him that this also allowed the amplification of telephonic voice signals. He attached the embossing point to a telephone diaphragm and created an indented paper record of his voice, he described this experiment in his notebook saying "[T]here is no doubt that I shall be able to store up and reproduce automatically at any future time the human voice perfectly”. 
Based on this experiment, Edison’s phonograph was born, finally with a long, narrow strip which this time wasn’t of paper anymore, but which was a thin tin foil strip which was fixed around a cylinder. By putting the cylinder in motion, with the needle put on it (with which the signal was engraved in the tin foil), it became possible to record and reproduce sound .
