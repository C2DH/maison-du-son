## A look at the history

Bush was a British consumer electronics company founded in the 30s. The company produced televisions and other electronic devices such as radios. In 1959, it launched the TR82 transistor radio, which proved a huge success. The fact that it was portable made it particularly appealing to teenagers. The design was created in 1954 by Ogle Design, a company based in Hertfordshire, and quickly became synonymous with the transistor radios of the early 60s. This model features a wooden cabinet, a rounded front panel and a unique speaker grille. Beyond its visual appeal, the TR82 was recognised for its durability and reliability.
