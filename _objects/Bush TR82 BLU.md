## A look at the history

Bush was a British consumer electronics company founded in the 30s. The company produced televisions and other electronic devices such as radios. In 1959, it launched the TR82 transistor radio, which proved a huge success. The fact that it was portable made it particularly appealing to teenagers. The design was created in 1954 by Ogle Design, a company based in Hertfordshire, and quickly became synonymous with the transistor radios of the early 60s. This model features a wooden cabinet, a rounded front panel and a unique speaker grille. Beyond its visual appeal, the TR82 was recognised for its durability and reliability.

## Be the Girl with the Bush

The slogan "Be the Girl with Bush" was an iconic Bush Radio advertising campaign to promote their TR82 model. It was used in the 1960s to specifically target a young, female audience. The slogan aimed to associate the product, the TR82 radio, with a modern lifestyle and the freedom of the times. The use of the word 'Girl' in the slogan was intended to create a connection with the young women of the time, inviting them to identify with the product and make it an integral part of their daily lives. By associating the product with a sense of individuality and modernity, the slogan aimed to position the TR82 radio as an essential accessory for the trendy youth of the time. It was a clever marketing campaign that capitalized on the trends and aspirations for emancipation of the youth of the 1960s.
